1- Using any programming language to write an application/program for discretizing any dataset. 
   You have to  use CAIM algorithm in your program for discretizing.
2- We will use 2 datasets : Iris and Heart Desease for running, testing result of your program 
   and also you do too for programming. You have to run CAIM algorithm with each feature (atribute)
   in each dataset and show/display result
   In Iris dataset, you have to discretize all feature (except class !) and in Heart dataset you only
   discretize numeric features (7 features)
3- You have to package your homework (in a compress file) include : source code, executable program
   (don't need dataset) and a brief description about how to run your program (syntax, notice when 
    running,version of programming language software...) in text format
    Be careful, VCU mail will check and deny any execute file (.exe,.com) so you have to change 
    extension part of your execute program before compressing
4- Send your package to me : nguyendt22@vcu.edu
5- When I received your package, i will reply to you for surely it's arrived
6- Due date of HW1 will be Thu 7-Oct-10 at midnight !!! (before 0 am 8-Otc-10)
