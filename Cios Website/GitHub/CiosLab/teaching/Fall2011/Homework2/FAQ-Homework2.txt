1- Using any programming language to write an application/program for classify datasets based on Clip4. 

2- We supply 4 datasets. Travel and Weather are small datasets which will help you checking your program (running step by step, debugging,..)
   And 2 datasets : Iris and Heart Desease for running,testing result of your program 
   But when grading, we only use 3 datasets Weather, Travel and Iris.
   All datasets has been discretized, you can convert these datasets to any format which you need, but in this case you have to send
   us your datasets (for running,testing when grading)

3- Your's outputs should be clear such as 
              IF  Type of Call = Local  && Lang Fluency = Fluent   THEN  Buy
              IF  petallength = (2.45-4.75]  && petalwidth = (0.8-1.75]   THEN  Class=Iris-versicolor
   
   Not should be like this
              IF  Type of Call = 1  && Lang Fluency = 0   THEN  1
              IF  petallength = 1  && petalwidth = 2   THEN  Class=2
   
   Total points of this HW are 10 include : 
	Exact result : 8 pts , user-interface : 2 pts
    
   You should be send your HW to me (Dat) 2-3 days before due date and I can give you some opinions for getting max points
   
4- You have to package your homework (in a compress file) include : source code, executable program
   (don't need dataset) and a brief description about how to run your program (syntax, notice when 
    running,version of programming language software...) in text format
    Be careful, VCU mail will check and deny any execute file (.exe,.com) so you have to change 
    extension part of your execute program before compressing
    
5- Send your package to me : nguyendt22@vcu.edu

6- When I received your package, i will reply to you for surely it's arrived

7- Due date of HW2 will be Wed Nov-09-2011 at midnight !!! (before 0 am Nov-10-2011)
